# kargo 

`kargo` is a `cargo` wrapper made for LLMs (Large Language Models) that allows them to work with cargo as an MCP tool
but shields them from:

- Huge context wasters like massage responses 
- Overwhelming output in the form of "too many error I'm freaking out!" (more to publish on this soon)
- Many tasks are autogenerated and researched in (near) real time.

## `sap` 

sap is a fully `ls` compatible substitute designed to produce dual streams in one traversal -- one for humans and one for LLM (aka ai agents).

the tool is available to agents alacart as an mcp tool or as part of (SweetMCP Server)[https://github.com/alacarte/sweetmcp-server]
